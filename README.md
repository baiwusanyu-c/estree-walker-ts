# estree-walker-ts
🥑 Simple utility for walking an [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant AST, such as one generated by [acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn).

English | [中文](https://github.com/baiwusanyu-c/estree-walker-ts/blob/master/README.ZH-CN.md)

## Feature

* 🧩 Support esm and cjs formats
* 🌈 Written in typescript
* ⛰ Support estree ast traversal
*  ⚡ Acorn's ast support

## Why is estree-walker-ts ?
The reason is simple, `estree-walker` currently does not support the use of cjs format, and the author does not seem to want to support this format, so I wrote it using typescript
And maintain it by yourself, its content is almost the same as that of `estree-walker`, and it also provides simple support for its type, but forgive me, I am not a typescript expert,
So if you have any problems using it, welcome 👏 to provide me with an issue.
Finally, thanks again to `estree-walker` and the author `Rich-Harris`.
